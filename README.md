## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
    cd project-repo
    ```

2. **Backend Setup** (For Java Spring Boot Projects)
    - Ensure you have **Java 8+** installed.
    - Run the application:
      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```

3. **Frontend Setup** (For React Projects)
    - Make sure **Node.js** and **npm** are installed.
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

4. **Database Setup**
    - Ensure **MongoDB** (or **SQLite**) is running locally or use a cloud service.
    - Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file for Spring Boot.
